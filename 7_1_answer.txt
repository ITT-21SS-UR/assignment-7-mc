What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?

TODO

The noise is created with the Gaussian pdf (probability density function) to test algorithm with “the same kind of data they will encounter in actual operation” (Chapter 2: Statistics, Digital Noise Generation)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
"Gaussian noise is statistical noise having a probability density function (PDF) equal to that of the normal distribution, which is also known as the Gaussian distribution."

Signals formed from random processes usually have a bell shaped pdf (probability density function or probability distribution function).
This is called a normal distribution, a Gauss distribution, or a Gaussian.

S. 30
Algorithms  need  to  be  tested  using  the  same  kind  of  data  they  will encounter  in  actual  operation.
This  creates  the  need  to  generate  digital noise  with  a  Gaussian  pdf.
There  are  two  methods  for  generating  such signals using a random number generator
.
The Central Limit Theorem provides the reason why normally distributed signals are seen so widely innature.
Whenever  many  different  random  forces  are  interacting,  the resulting pdf becomes a Gaussian.

What does a low-pass filter do in general?

In general a "low-pass filter is designed to block all frequencies above the cutoff frequency (the stopband),
while passing all frequencies below (the passband)." (chapter 3, p. 52)
E. g. digital low-pass filters can be utilized for noise reduction, signal separation, wave shaping, etc. (chapter 7, p. 128)

“All frequencies below the cutoff frequency, fc, are passed with unity amplitude, while all higher frequencies are blocked.”
(chapter 16, Windowed-Sinc Filters - Strategy of the Windowed-Sinc)

By converting low pass filter to the correct respond High-pass, band-pass and band-reject filters are designed.

Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?

We assume that the moving average filter is a low-pass filter because according to the book
the moving average filter is "an exceptionally bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain)"
and "an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the  action in the time domain)" (chapter 15, S. 280).
Another reason is that the term high-pass filter was not mentioned in this chapter.
Also the filter reduces “random white noise while keeping the sharpest [highest] step response", what a low pass filter would do.

As the name implies, the moving average filter operates by averaging a number of points from the input signal to produce each point in the output signal.

S. 277
In spite of its simplicity, the moving average filter is optimal for a common task: reducing random noise while retaining a sharp step response.
This makes it the premier filter for time domain encoded signals.
However, the moving average is the worst filter for frequency domain encoded signals, with little ability to separate one band of frequencies from another.

S. 278
Not  only  is  the  moving  average  filter  very  good  for  many applications, it is optimal for a common problem, reducing random white noise while keeping the sharpest step response.

S. 280
In  short, the moving average is an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the  action in the time domain), but an exceptionally bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain).
