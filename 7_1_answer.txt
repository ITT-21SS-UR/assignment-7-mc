What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?

The defining property of Gaussian noise is that it has a
probability density function (pdf) which is normally distributed
and usually has a bell shaped pdf named after the German mathematician,
Karl Friedrich Gauss (chapter 2).

The noise is created with the Gaussian pdf to test algorithm with
“the same kind of data they will encounter in actual operation” (chapter 2, p. 30).

What does a low-pass filter do in general?

In general a "low-pass filter is designed to block all frequencies above
the cutoff frequency (the stopband), while passing all frequencies below
(the passband)." (chapter 3, p. 52)

E. g. digital low-pass filters can be utilized for noise reduction, signal
separation, wave shaping, etc. (chapter 7, p. 128)

By converting low pass filter to the correct respond high-pass, band-pass
and band-reject filters are designed (chapter 16).

Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?

We concluded that the moving average filter is a low-pass filter.
According to the book the moving average filter is "an exceptionally
bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain)" and
"an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the  action in the time domain)"
(chapter 15, p. 280).

Another reason is that the term high-pass filter was not mentioned in chapter 15.
Also the filter reduces “random white noise while keeping the sharpest
[highest] step response", what a low pass filter would do.
